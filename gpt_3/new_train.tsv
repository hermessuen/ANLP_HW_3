34697	Yes, I‚Äôm aware. [NAME] loves LA and he isn‚Äôt worth 18 mil so he‚Äôd gladly take it.	27	edx4w6k
34698	[NAME] fell asleep on defense I'm sorry you felt that way.	27	efblznl
34699	It's beautiful. I would eat it with gusto. Do something more shitty in the future	0	edr35n3

34715	So we are really going to miss the playoffs in the same season as the 10 game win streak... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE !	9	ee4rux5
